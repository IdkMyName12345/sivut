            <h1>Music I enjoy:</h1>
            <ul>
                <p>I enjoy a variety of genres. The main three in my opinion are rock, metal and ambience.</p>
                <p>on this page you can find short descriptions i have written about my favorite genres.</p>
                <p>I'm planning on adding a ability to listen to my favorite songs from this website but that is WIP.</p>
                <br>
                <p>rock:</p>
                <p>There really isn't alot i have to say about rock music. It's rock music and i love it.</p>
                <br>
                <p>metal:</p>
                <p>when it comes to metal. i like all sorts, but i have always loved black metal the most</p>
                <p>black metal is in my opinion the superior metal genre</p>
                <br>
                <p>ambience:</p>
                <p>ambience.. where do i begin. ambience is the perfect music to have playing in the background in your life.</p>
                <p>I like all sorts of music that can be considered ambient. Mostly I have always loved dark ambience tho</p>
